    Note:
        The problem says to use the first 10 terms of the Taylor series to calculate,
        but in actual testing, no matter what, the result always only reaches a WA80 score.

        Therefore, I changed it to use the first 100 terms to calculate.

        Special attention: When determining whether a number is an integer (that is, using (fabs(sum - floor(sum)) < 1e-6)),
                           if a looser criterion is used (for example, 1e-3 or below),
                           fewer terms in the Taylor series expansion are needed;
                           conversely, if a stricter criterion is applied (for example, 1e-6 or above),
                           more terms in the Taylor series expansion are required.

        Conclusion: It is better to directly increase the number of iterations in the for loop (the higher, the more precise).
