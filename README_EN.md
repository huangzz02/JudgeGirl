# Introduction

Language： [中文](./README.md) | English

This is a backup of the problems I've solved on [Judge Girl](http://120.126.151.220/problems/domains).  
Although these codes have passed the tests, they may not be the optimal solutions. They are for reference only.

## Project Structure

Each folder usually contains the following files：

- **`.c` or `.py`**：Source code files  
- **`.exe`**：Executable files (C only)

## Project Goals

1. **Cloud Backup**：Save my code for future reference.  
2. **Share and Learn**：Provide reference for others, but please do not copy and paste directly!  
3. **Improve Ranking**：Currently ranked **#1** on Judge Girl's [Ranklist](http://120.126.151.220/ranklist).
